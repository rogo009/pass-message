# pass-message
local pass message

##This was a fun, small project to practice vanilla JS and CSS. It's a simple app that takes the user input and prints to the page. This app focuses on dom manipulation. 

##Practiced using JS to dynamically add or remove classes to document based on conditions set in the function.

##played around with styling and displaying the error div a few ways. I chose to have a separate CSS class and dynamically assign (add) class if conditions were met within the function. 

##also implemented the setTimeout(function, 3000); for this project as well. chose to include an anonymous function within the setTimeout();

##overall this was great practice for: DOM manipulation, setTimeout() and toggling error message via JS.
